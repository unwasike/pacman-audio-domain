FPGA Pac-Man Audio Core
This repository contains the audio core module for the FPGA implementation of the classic Pac-Man game, developed on the ZedBoard FPGA.

Overview
The audio core is responsible for generating sound effects and managing audio playback in the FPGA-based Pac-Man game. The core was designed with performance and low-latency in mind, leveraging FPGAâ€™s parallel processing capabilities to synchronize game events with corresponding audio outputs.
